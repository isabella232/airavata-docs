## Django Gateway Theme Management
In Django portal, the gateway branding or the theme is managed through a CMS. The Djangop portal uses WagTail CMS for the theme.<br>
The CMS takes care fo the gateway home page, child pages content. <br>
Gateways are initially deployed with a common base theme, but the gateway admins can re-brand according to their needs.<br>
In order to change the theme user needs to be in the Admin group.<br>
